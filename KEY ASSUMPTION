KEY ASSUMPTION:

CompanyName is declared as a PCDATA element in all the 3 DTDs being shared here.
This is with the assumption that '&' in the company names will be replaced with
'&amp;' in the XML records, prior to validation against the DTD to ensure successful XML parsing.

Validation against DTDs will be successful only if the above assumption is correct.
